This approach is used to develop robust generative diffusion models and is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset."

      "summary": "The problem involves detecting a drift in a Brownian motion with false negatives and costs for inspections. It is formulated as an optimal multiple stopping problem which is equivalent to a recursive optimal stopping problem. By using free boundary methods, explicit formulas for the expected cost and optimal strategy are derived."
